# Quick Start

## Getting Started

Yoker provides an interactive chat interface with Ollama and tool calling capabilities.

**Architecture**: Yoker uses an event-driven, library-first design. The Agent emits events
(thinking chunks, content, tool calls) that a `UIHandler` receives through a `UIBridge`.
This makes the library usable in headless, web, and GUI contexts without terminal logic
leaking into the agent.

:alt: Architecture Diagram
```

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- An LLM provider — Ollama (free tier), OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini.
  Run `python -m yoker` with no config to launch the bootstrap wizard, which
  guides you through provider selection and model setup.

### Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or from PyPI:

```bash
pip install yoker
```

### Run

```bash
python -m yoker
```

Or with an agent definition:

```bash
python -m yoker --agents-definition examples/agents/researcher.md
```

### Library Usage (Headless)

Yoker is designed to be embedded as a library. The `yoker` package exposes a thin
Pythonic facade (MBI-003) over the `Agent` and `Session` classes, plus a lower-level
event-driven API for full control.

#### Python API (recommended)

The facade lives in `yoker.api` and is re-exported from the top-level `yoker` package.
The primary entry points are:

| Function | Use |
|----------|-----|
| `yoker.process(prompt, **kwargs)` | One-shot turn; returns the response string. |
| `yoker.do(skill_name, prompt, args="", **kwargs)` | One-shot skill invocation. |
| `yoker.agent(**kwargs) -> Agent` | Builder that returns a reusable `Agent`. |
| `yoker.session(id=..., *, persist=True, fresh=False, **kwargs)` | Async context manager yielding a multi-turn `Session` with context persistence. |
| `yoker.run_sync(coro)` | Wraps `asyncio.run` for synchronous callers (scripts, notebooks, REPLs). |

All builder kwargs (`model`, `provider`, `system_prompt`, `tools`, `skills`,
`plugins`, `thinking`, `event_handler`, `config`, ...) are accepted by `process`,
`do`, `agent`, and `session`.

One-shot, single response:

```python
import asyncio

import yoker


async def main():
    answer = await yoker.process("What is 2+2?")
    print(answer)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Synchronous caller (scripts, notebooks):

```python
import yoker

answer = yoker.run_sync(yoker.process("What files are in the current directory?"))
print(answer)
```

A reusable, configured agent:

```python
import asyncio

import yoker
from yoker.events import ToolCallEvent


async def main():
    reviewer = yoker.agent(
        model="qwen3.5:cloud",
        system_prompt="You are a security-focused code reviewer. Cite file:line.",
        tools=["read", "search", "list"],
        thinking="visible",
    )

    def log_tools(event):
        if isinstance(event, ToolCallEvent):
            print(f"[tool] {event.tool_name}({event.arguments})")

    reviewer.on_event(log_tools)

    report = await reviewer.process("Review src/yoker/plugins/security.py for vulnerabilities.")
    print(report)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Multi-turn conversation with automatic context persistence — re-opening the same
id restores history:

```python
import asyncio

import yoker


async def main():
    async with yoker.session(id="refactor-auth") as session:
        await session.agent.process("Read src/auth.py and identify the main responsibilities.")
        await session.agent.process("Suggest a refactor that splits authentication from session management.")


asyncio.run(main())
```

Invoke a skill by name as a one-shot command:

```python
import asyncio

import yoker


async def main():
    result = await yoker.do("commit", "stage and commit current changes")
    print(result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

For the full set of examples, see `examples/python_api/` (`one_shot.py`,
`agent_builder.py`, `session.py`, `run_skill.py`, `workflow.py`,
`event_handling.py`, `sync_usage.py`).

#### Low-level event-driven API (advanced)

For full control — custom rendering, non-terminal surfaces, or when you need to
drive the UI lifecycle yourself — use the `Agent` class directly with a
`UIHandler` and `UIBridge`. The example below uses the built-in
`BatchUIHandler` and `UIBridge` to render agent events without the CLI.

```python
import asyncio

from yoker import Agent
from yoker.config import get_yoker_config
from yoker.ui import BatchUIHandler, UIBridge


async def main():
    # Load configuration from environment variables, ~/.yoker.toml,
    # ./yoker.toml, and built-in defaults.
    config = get_yoker_config(cli=False)

    # Create the agent. All heavy lifting (context, tools, guardrails)
    # is configured from the Config object.
    agent = Agent(config=config)

    # Create a UI handler and bridge agent events to it.
    ui = BatchUIHandler(show_thinking=True, show_tool_calls=True)
    bridge = UIBridge(ui)
    agent.on_event(bridge)

    # Start the UI, process a message, then shut down.
    await ui.start(agent)
    try:
        await agent.process("What is 2+2?")
    finally:
        await ui.shutdown("complete")


asyncio.run(main())
```

For a fully custom integration, implement the `UIHandler` protocol and wire it
through `UIBridge`. See `examples/custom_handler.py` for a minimal custom handler.

### Async Model

Yoker is built with an async-first architecture:

- **All Agent methods are async**: `process()` is a coroutine.
- **UI handlers are async**: Input, lifecycle, and streaming methods use `await`.
- **Event handlers can be sync or async**: Handlers receive events in the same asyncio
task as `process()`.

```python
from yoker import Agent
from yoker.events import TurnEndEvent


class DatabaseHandler:
    """Example async handler writing to a database."""

    def __init__(self, db_connection):
        self.db = db_connection

    async def __call__(self, event) -> None:
        if isinstance(event, TurnEndEvent):
            # Direct await - no run_coroutine_threadsafe needed!
            await self.db.save_response(event.response)


async def main():
    agent = Agent()  # model resolved from config or agent definition
    agent.on_event(DatabaseHandler(db))
    await agent.process("Hello")  # Handler runs in the same event loop
```

**Threading Model:**

| Context | Where handlers run |
|---------|---------------------|
| `await agent.process()` | Same asyncio task |
| Interactive CLI | Main asyncio event loop |
| Web server (FastAPI) | Request handler's event loop |

Handlers run synchronously within the asyncio event loop. For long-running operations,
use async handlers that yield control (for example, `await asyncio.sleep(0)`) or offload
to a separate executor.

### Interactive Session

```
Yoker v0.5.0 - Using model: qwen3.5:cloud
Type /help for available commands.
Press Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z on Windows) to quit.

> /help

Available commands:

  /help - Show available commands
  /think - Enable/disable thinking mode: /think [on|off]
  /skills - List available skills
  /context - Show current conversation context
  /tools - List all known tools with availability
  /agents - Show loaded agent and known agents

Type a message without / prefix to chat with the LLM.

> What's in the README.md file?

I'll read the README.md file for you.

The README.md file describes **Yoker**, a Python-based agent harness...

> ^D
Goodbye!
```

### Interactive Input Features

The session supports:

| Feature | How to use |
|---------|------------|
| Multiline input | `Esc+Enter` adds newlines, `Enter` submits |
| Command history | `Up`/`Down` arrows navigate previous messages |
| History search | `Ctrl+R` searches through history |
| Mouse support | Click to position cursor |

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/think on\|off\|silent` | Enable, disable, or silence LLM thinking trace |
| `/skills` | List available skills |
| `/context` | Show current conversation context |
| `/tools` | List all known tools with availability |
| `/agents` | Show loaded agent and known agents |

Any command name that matches a loaded skill is treated as a skill invocation. For
example, if a skill named `example` is loaded, `/example` injects the skill content
into the conversation.

### Thinking Mode

When enabled, the LLM shows its reasoning process in gray:

```
[Thinking]
Let me analyze this request...
I should check the file structure first...

[Response]
Based on my analysis, here's what I found...
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
python -m yoker --help
```

Key options generated from the Clevis configuration schema:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--backend-ollama-model MODEL` | Model to use (overrides config) |
| `--agents-definition PATH` | Path to agent definition file (Markdown with frontmatter) |
| `--ui-mode interactive\|batch` | Run in interactive or batch mode |
| `--ui-show-thinking` | Show thinking output |
| `--ui-show-tool-calls` | Show tool call information |
| `--ui-show-stats` | Show turn statistics |
| `--with PACKAGE` | Load a Python package plugin (repeatable) |

The `--with` argument is intercepted before Clevis parses the rest of the command line,
so it can be combined with any other option:

```bash
python -m yoker --with yoker_plugin_demo --agents-definition examples/agents/researcher.md
```

### Session Persistence

Yoker supports session persistence for resuming conversations. Configure it in
`yoker.toml`:

```toml
[context]
manager = "basic_persistence"
storage_path = "./context"
session_id = "auto"
persist_after_turn = true
```

When `persist_after_turn` is true, the session is saved after each turn. To resume a
specific session, set `session_id` to the previously generated id.

**Programmatic usage (recommended):** the `yoker.session` facade handles
persistence for you — pass an `id` and leave `persist=True` (the default).
Re-opening the same id restores the previous conversation history automatically.

```python
import asyncio

import yoker


async def main():
    # First run: start a conversation under a named id.
    async with yoker.session(id="my-session") as session:
        await session.agent.process("What is 2+2?")

    # Later run: re-open the same id to resume history.
    async with yoker.session(id="my-session") as session:
        await session.agent.process("Now what is 4+4?")


asyncio.run(main())
```

**Lower-level manual construction:** the `Persisted` context-manager wrapper
(`yoker.context.Persisted`) wraps a base in-memory manager and persists turns to
JSONL. The storage path comes from the `Config` (the `context.storage_path`
field), not a constructor argument.

```python
import asyncio

from yoker import Agent
from yoker.config import get_yoker_config
from yoker.context import Persisted, SimpleContextManager


async def main():
    config = get_yoker_config(cli=False)
    # storage_path is read from config.context.storage_path
    context = Persisted(SimpleContextManager(), session_id="my-session")

    agent = Agent(config=config, context_manager=context)
    await agent.process("What is 2+2?")

    # Later, construct another Persisted with the same session_id to
    # load the previous conversation automatically.


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Tools

Yoker provides several tools for file operations, web access, and subagent spawning:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read` | Read file contents with guardrails |
| `list` | Directory listing with pattern filtering |
| `write` | Write files with overwrite protection |
| `update` | Edit existing files with replace/insert/delete |
| `search` | Search file contents or filenames |
| `existence` | Check if files or folders exist |
| `mkdir` | Create directories with parent creation |
| `git` | Git operations with permission-controlled commit/push |
| `agent` | Spawn subagents with isolated context |
| `skill` | Invoke skills dynamically by name |
| `websearch` | Web search with SSRF protection and domain filtering |
| `webfetch` | Fetch web content with SSRF protection and URL validation |

### Agent Tool

The `agent` tool allows spawning subagents for specialized tasks:

```{image} _static/demo-agent-tool.svg
:alt: Agent Tool Demo
```

```
> Use the agent tool to spawn a researcher agent to find all TODO comments

[Tool Call] agent(agent_path="examples/agents/researcher.md", prompt="Find all TODO comments")

The researcher agent found 15 TODO items across the codebase...
```

Key features:
- **Isolated context**: Subagents start with fresh context
- **Timeout**: 5-minute default execution limit
- **Tool filtering**: Subagents use only their defined tools

### Skill Tool

The `skill` tool allows the agent to invoke skills dynamically by name:

```
> use the example skill

[Tool Call] skill(skill_name="example")
```

Key features:
- **Dynamic loading**: Skills are loaded from configured `skills.directories`
- **Full content**: Returns the complete skill content for the agent to follow
- **Args support**: Pass arguments to skills via the `args` parameter
- **Discovery**: Available skills shown in the system reminder

## Plugins

External Python packages can provide tools, skills, and agents through the plugin
system.

**Important**: Plugins are disabled by default. Enable them in your configuration:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = true
```

Then load plugins with `--with`:

```bash
# Install and load a plugin
pip install pkgq
python -m yoker --with pkgq
```

When you load a plugin for the first time, Yoker displays a confirmation dialog
showing the plugin's components. Review them carefully—plugins can execute
arbitrary code on your system.

After accepting a plugin, you can trust it permanently by adding to your config:

```toml
[plugins.trusted]
pkgq = true
```

Verify loaded components with `/skills` and `/tools` commands.

For comprehensive plugin documentation including the complete workflow, security
best practices, and troubleshooting, see [Using Plugins](plugins.md).

See `examples/plugins/demo/README.md` for plugin development guide.

## Agent Definitions

Yoker supports loading agent definitions from Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
This allows you to define custom system prompts and tool availability.

### Agent Definition Format

Create a file like `examples/agents/researcher.md`:

```markdown
---
name: researcher
description: Research assistant that searches and reads files
tools: List, Read, Search
color: blue
---

# Researcher Agent

You are a research assistant specialized in finding and analyzing information.

## Workflow

1. Use Search to find relevant files
2. Use Read to examine file contents
3. Compile findings into a structured report
```

### Using Agent Definitions

```bash
# Load an agent definition
python -m yoker --agents-definition examples/agents/researcher.md
```

Programmatically:

```python
from yoker import Agent
from yoker.agents import load_agent_definition, validate_agent_definition
from yoker.config import get_yoker_config

# Load configuration and agent
config = get_yoker_config(cli=False)
agent_def = load_agent_definition("examples/agents/researcher.md")

# Validate agent tools against config
warnings = validate_agent_definition(agent_def, config.tools)

# Create agent with definition
agent = Agent(config=config, agent_definition=agent_def)
```

### Example Agents

| Agent | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Main | `examples/agents/main.md` | Default assistant with read-only tools |
| Researcher | `examples/agents/researcher.md` | Research assistant with search capabilities |
| Markdown | `examples/agents/markdown.md` | Formats all responses as structured Markdown |

## Configuration

### Configuration File

Create a `yoker.toml` file in your project directory:

```toml
[harness]
name = "my-yoke"

[logging]
level = "INFO"

[backend]
provider = "ollama"  # or "openai", "anthropic", "gemini", or any litellm provider

[backend.ollama]
base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
model = "qwen3.5:cloud"
timeout_seconds = 60

[backend.ollama.parameters]
temperature = 0.7
top_p = 0.9

[agents]
definition = "./agents/researcher.md"  # Optional: agent definition file

[tools.read]
enabled = true
allowed_extensions = [".txt", ".md", ".py"]
```

For OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini, change the provider and use the matching
config section. API keys can be interpolated from environment variables via
Clevis (`${VAR}` syntax):

```toml
[backend]
provider = "anthropic"

[backend.anthropic]
api_key = "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
model = "claude-haiku-4-5"
```

See `examples/yoker.toml` for the full configuration reference and
{doc}`models` for the curated model lists per provider.

### Environment Variables

Yoker auto-discovers configuration files in this order:

1. `./yoker.toml` (current directory)
2. `~/.yoker.toml` (user home directory)
3. Built-in defaults

You can also specify an explicit config file with Clevis:

```bash
python -m yoker --config path/to/config.toml
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read` | Read file contents |
| `list` | List directory contents with pattern filtering |
| `write` | Write content to files with overwrite protection |
| `update` | Edit existing files with replace, insert, and delete |
| `search` | Search file contents with regex or filenames with glob |
